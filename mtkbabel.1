.SH NAME
mtkbabel \- Tool for managing i-Blue 747 and compatible GPS data loggers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mtkbabel \fR[\fB\-abdEfhlmoprtvw\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mtkbabel
is a command line program to operate the i-Blue 747 GPS data logger.
It should work also with other GPS devices based on the MediaTek MTK chipset.
.sp
The main features are:
 - Command line interface
 - Save data log in GPX and raw binary format
 - If required retrieve all the data, also the old one being overlapped
 - Change logging criteria: time, distance, speed
 - Change log format
 - START/STOP logging
 - Set OVERLAP or STOP method on memory full
 - Erase the internal memory
.SH USAGE
In order to use mtkbabel, please follow these instructions:
.sp
1. Attach the GPS data logger device to your computer
.BR "via USB" .
.sp
2. Now you have to switch the GPS device (at least the i-Blue 747) into
.BR "LOG or NAV mode" ,
otherwise the device will not be powered on, and no connection will
be possible. Beware that in NAV mode the device goes into sleep mode if
not connected to any Bluetooth device.
.sp
3. In order to use mtkbabel you have to either be root (not recommended)
and/or you must have read/write permissions for the USB device file, usually
.BR /dev/ttyUSB0 .
This device usually has permissions
.BR "'crw-rw---- 1 root dialout'" ,
so you can either add your user to the
.B dialout
group (in this example) by doing
.sp
.B "   $ adduser USERNAME dialout"
.sp
or (not recommended) make the device world-readable/-writable by doing:
.sp
.B "   $ chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0"
.sp
Another option is to write a udev rules file to change the owner and
permissions of /dev/ttyUSB0 according to your requirements.
.sp
4. You can now run mtkbabel. For example, if you want to download the
track log and the list of waypoints you captured on the device, run:
.sp
.B "   $ mtkbabel -l off -f foo -w -t"
.sp
This will turn off the autolog function, which is always turned on when you
switch on the device. The track log will be in the file
.BR foo_trk.gpx ,
the waypoints in the file
.B foo_wpt.gpx
(both in GPX format). The file
.B foo.bin
will contain the binary log file. Downloading the data from the GPS device
can take several minutes, depending on how much data has to be transferred.
.sp
In order to delete all data from the GPS device, run:
.sp
.B "   $ mtkbabel -E"
